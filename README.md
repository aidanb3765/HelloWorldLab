# Hello World Lab
Hello World Lab is a program created for taking a user entered name and printing out a specified phrase within an android emulation.

# Useful 
This project is useful for understanding and implementing a simulated phone application that takes a user response and then displaying 
that input as output. The project allows the user to use components such as click me buttons, name edit text, and display text view. 
The project also contains tests for execution on an Android device, local runs on development machines (host), as well as bundling various 
events within the device. Hello World Lab demonstrates the responses listeners to take text variables and create instances to be saved/updated 
with what is provided by user. This demonstration allows for one to understand the class system of various properties in creating and updating 
the layout of the virtual android device through coding. After reading the commendations and running the project, you will begin to see 
and understand what is programmed into a device that will print out a phrase, take user input, and print out that input in a simplistic and easy to follow way.
